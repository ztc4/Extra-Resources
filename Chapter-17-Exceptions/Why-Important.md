## Why It's Important

- Used extensively in APIs (servers) to ensure the server doesn't shut down due to errors.
- Typically employed to mitigate situations that could potentially shut down your server.
- Serves as an advanced version of the if-else statement.

## What It Means

- Attempt the following code, but if any errors occur, then execute the specified actions.
- You can throw an error using the `throw new Error("blah blah")` syntax.
- In the `catch(e)` block, the `e` represents the information you provided in the `throw new Error("blah blah")` part.

## Examples of Errors

- Unable to connect to the database at a certain time.
- Failed to properly execute a subsequent action, such as looking up a user.
